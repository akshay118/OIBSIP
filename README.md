TASK 1   IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
This repository contains code and resources for implementing a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers using logistic regression. The Iris flower dataset is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for classification tasks.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which consists of measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for 150 iris flowers. Each flower is labeled with one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica. The dataset is widely used for teaching and research purposes due to its simplicity and clear separation between classes.
